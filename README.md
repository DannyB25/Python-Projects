# Python-Projects

Hello! Thanks for stopping by my Python-Projects Repository! This repository is dedicated to my preliminary learning experience with the Python Programming Language and to demonstrate my growth and acquity at Python. I have enjoyed learninging all sorts of basic information about this language and then applying that knowledge into creating interesting and wonderful creations. A brief description of these works include:

## The Phonebook Project
A software project that operates as a phonebook for the user of the site. By inputting information, such as a someone's name, number and email address, this program will retain that information in a database and allow the user to retain, delete and retrieve that stores contact information. Very handy and practical! 

## The File Transfer Project
This software allows an operator to move files from a source folder into a destination folder. It also saves these moved files in a database for later inspection and to act as a reminder. 

## Django Checkbook Project 
This Django Framework enabled project acts as a banking system for the user. This was created through the PyCharm program and utilized many different modules to come to fruition. Through this code, you can create your own personal account, deposit/withdraw funds, check in on your holdings and more! It is a super functional and applicable piece of software.   

## In conclusion
Please look through my projects as I am sure there will be entertaining and helpful code contained within and you will have fun seeing all of the cool products within. Thanks again!
